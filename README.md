# SPI-Serial-Peripheral-Interface-Protocol-LED-Program-in-PIC

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a full-duplex synchronous communication protocol used to transfer data between a Master and one or more Slave devices. Unlike I2C, it is faster and simpler but requires more pins.

🔹 SPI Lines
MOSI (Master Out Slave In): Data from Master → Slave
MISO (Master In Slave Out): Data from Slave → Master
SCK (Serial Clock): Clock generated by Master
SS / CS (Slave Select / Chip Select): Selects the active Slave (active LOW)

📌 SPI in PIC (via MSSP Module)
PIC microcontrollers implement SPI through the MSSP (Master Synchronous Serial Port) module, which supports both SPI and I2C.

Configuration Steps:
Configure MSSP module in SPI mode.
Select Master or Slave role.
Set clock polarity (CKP) and clock phase (CKE) based on device requirements.
Set baud rate for SPI clock.
Enable MSSP and start communication.

🧩 SPI Data Frame (8-bit)
Master pulls SS low to select the slave.
Master sends 8-bit data via MOSI, while simultaneously receiving data from MISO.
Each clock pulse (SCK) shifts one bit in and out.
After transfer, Master can release SS high.

⚙️ Applications of SPI in PIC
Interfacing with External EEPROMs/Flash
Communication with ADC/DAC modules
Interfacing sensors (e.g., accelerometers, temperature sensors)
Driving LCD/OLED displays
Microcontroller-to-Microcontroller data transfer

📌 Example Programs in PIC
SPI Master Initialization – Configures PIC as SPI master.
SPI Slave Initialization – Configures PIC as SPI slave.
SPI Data Transfer – Master sends data, slave responds.

SPI with LED – Sending data from master to slave to turn ON/OFF LEDs.

SPI with EEPROM – Read/Write data to external memory.
